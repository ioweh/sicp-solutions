This is my solutions to the sicp course.

To load any file into the interpreter, run the following command:

(load "differentiation.scm")

A more complex example:

(load "C:\\Desktop\\sicp-solutions\\2.5\\generic-arithmetic-operations.scm")

If you run scheme on windows, open the right-click menu of the MIT-GNU Scheme shortcut and choose properties, next edit the Start in option to your likes and preferences.

For the text to be copied from Edwin, set a mark: [Ctrl-spacebar]
Then copy it: [Meta-W]
To paste back from Windows: [Ctrl-Y]

Note that the mit-scheme-9.0.1 doesn't open the files correctly. The version 9.0 works just fine.
