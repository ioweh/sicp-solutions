1.2.2  Tree Recursion

You can see that Fib(2) expands to 2 leaves. Fib(1) expands to just 1. Clearly, Fib(3) is the sum of the leaves taken from Fib(2), which is 2, and Fib(1), which is 1. We can see that their sum is the value of Fib(4). We see that the values are shifted in this case, but the counting process remains the same, the number of leaves on the n-th step is Fib(n+1).

Note: there's a more detailed proof by math induction. All you have to do is to prove the base case and then move on to the induction step.

A pretty clear explanation is given in wikipedia:

Exercise 1.15:

To understand the trigonometric stuff, see this notions here:

"There are many easy ways, but since you probably know the formulas for the sine and cosine of 2x and of a+b, just use those formulas on 3x = 2x + x"

Also, see this one for an explanation why sin x = x when x is small:

The Fermat test

A number can be represented in the following way:

a = x*n + rem(a/n)
b = y*n + rem(b/n)

where rem is the remainder of a divided by n

Then

rem(a*b/n) = rem((x*n + rem(a/n))(y*n + rem(b/n))/n) = 
= rem(x*n*y*n/n) + rem(x*n*rem(b/n)/n) + rem(y*n*rem(a/n)/n) + rem(rem(a/n)*rem(b/n)/n)

rem(x*n*y*n/n) = 0       as x*n*y*n divides by n
rem(x*n*rem(b/n)/n) = 0  as x*n*rem(b/n) divides by n
rem(y*n*rem(a/n)/n) = 0  as y*n*rem(a/n) divides by n

The only one term is left: 

rem(rem(a/n)*rem(b/n)/n)

Then the initial equation can be reduced to the following:

rem(a*b/n) = rem(rem(a/n)*rem(b/n)/n)

Let's test it

a = 9
b = 8
n = 5

rem(9*8/5) = rem(72/5) = 2
rem(9*8/5) = rem(rem(9/5)*rem(8/5)/5) = rem(4*3/5) = rem(12/5) = 2
