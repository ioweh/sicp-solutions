a. The apply-generic procedure will execute recursively, as it will find the coercion and execute the apply-generic procedure over and over again with the very same arguments that were called the first time the procedure was executed.

b. We can not call the code further down after the check for the procedure to save some time.

c. For that, we just need to add a small check if the arguments are of the same type and report an error that there is no method for these types. We can do it like that:


(define (apply-generic op . args)
...
(if (and (= (length args) 2) (not (equal? (car type-tags) (cadr type-tags))))
...

Here, we just modified the check in the apply-generic procedure so that it filters numbers of the same type.
